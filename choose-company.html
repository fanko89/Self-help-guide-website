            Most homeowners don’t lose money because they chose the wrong brand.
            They lose money because the work was not designed, installed, and verified correctly.
            This page shows you what to ask, what proof to request, and how to tell who is doing it “by the book.”

        <p class="lead">
          Reviews can be helpful, but not all platforms carry the same level of trust.
          Some reviews reflect real completed work. Others reflect marketing budgets.
        </p>

        <div class="big-q">Google vs Yelp (what most people don’t realize)</div>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            <b>Google reviews</b> are easy for anyone to leave and are not tied to a verified job.
            Large private equity-backed companies often invest heavily in review campaigns, which can inflate ratings without proving quality work was done.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Yelp reviews</b> are typically tied to an actual service interaction.
            Yelp requires user accounts, tracks reviewer history, and limits who can leave reviews for a company - making it harder to post unrelated or paid feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Star count alone means very little. A high rating does not guarantee correct diagnostics or proper installation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use reviews as a starting filter, then rely on <b>process and proof</b> to make a decision.
